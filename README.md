# Library-Project
This project has taught me and helped me:

* How event delegation works
* New JavaScript object constructors and methods
* How to work with dialogs
* How to grab form data with JavaScript
* How to create functional toggle buttons
* Get better at structuring code
* Get better at committing gits more often
* Get better at creating simple yet effective UIs
* Get better at working with JavaScript loops, arrays, DOM injection, DOM manipulation, event listeners, and functions
* Get better at working with forms, data collection, and data manipulation

I'm proud of this project, I struggled the most I ever have, but I eventually figured out the logic I needed for it to work. Particularly grabbing the specific book to remove it was the most difficult task for me. I learned about event delegation and used the book's ID as data to grab and remove it from the library.

I think my code could be written more efficiently and to better practices, but I did the best I know how and wrote it for legibility. This is something I will work to get better at as I start larger projects.

My library project does everything I wanted it to do, I have a functioning view switcher, edit and remove buttons, even a button to change the username. The page sizes well for different screens and I like the colors I chose.

The only problem I see is that I did not loop through my library array and use a constructor function the way the project asked. I store data in my library array and reference it for functions, but I do not loop through it to display my library. I am still kind of confused on constructor functions and the benefits they have so instead of using one for creating books, I just used a regular function tied to an event listener. I will come back to this project a while from now when I know more and reflect on anything I missed.
